# Finding HTML Canvas element difficult? Use this library instead

# Using the canvas element

I had such high expectations when I started creating a business card creator with JavaScript.

In my mind, I thought converting a section of HTML into a PNG file would be simple.

It was a struggle as I realized I'd have to draw the designs I wanted right on the canvas element.

This is where things really got tedious because I needed to manipulate the canvas, set the width, apply different styles on the canvas, among other set ups.

Now, my interest in web development lies more on the logic, than the design part.

At the moment, there is no function that allows one to convert a part of an html markup apart from the canvas element.

Which is why I was ecstatic to discover the **html2canvas library.**

Its role is simple, the library allows you to take a snapshot of any section you indicated and you can convert it to a PNG file. Without manually setting up the canvas element.

Best part, the dependencies doesn't take up as much space

\*\*Let's work on a real life project with this. \*\*

For this, our goal is to convert this business card to a PNG file.

And to get to the crux of the matter, I'll be using this codepen design from Mohcine Dev

So, you can get the html and css from this codepen: https://codepen.io/MohcineDev/pen/vYXeqZm

You just need to wrap the html file inside an article element. Then, we need a button outside the article container -

So, your html file should end up like this ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/form.css" />
    <title>html2canvas library</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Canvas -->
    <article id="card-container">
     <!-- HTML from https://codepen.io/MohcineDev/pen/vYXeqZm -->
    </article>

    <section class="down-button">
      <button class="download-card" id="download-card-btn">
        Download card
      </button>
      <a href="#" id="download-link" download="MyBusinessCard.png"></a>
    </section>
    <script src="https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/dist/html2canvas.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

For the CSS file, you can also use the same [codepen](https://codepen.io/MohcineDev/pen/vYXeqZm)

And use the below CSS for the button section

```javascript
#download-card-btn {
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  width: 40%;
  background-color: black;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

#download-card-btn {
  margin-left: 20px;
  width: 180px;
}

#download-card-btn:hover {
  transition: 0.5s ease-in;
  opacity: 0.7;
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

## Installing html2canvas library

With HTML Canvas, it's quite simple

You can install html 2canvas as an **npm package**, or just add the script element on your html file

If you are conversant with npm, you simply need to run the following on your terminal `npm install --save html2canvas`

But for the purposes of this project, we'll just use the script link already in the html file

```javascript
<script src="https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/dist/html2canvas.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 1 - Setting up the project

As seen in our html file, we'd want to convert the container to PNG file

Usually, you'd have to create a new canvas. Then draw the designs right on the canvas

However, for front-end developers like me who prefer the logic side of development to the design, html2canvas is a lifesaver.

Now, to get to the nitty gritty.

This is the business card on a webpage.

![business card webscreen.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667702819387/B6P86qkSs.png align="left")

Our goal is this... **when the download Card button is clicked, we want to download the front part of the business card.**

So how do we go about this?

In the HTML markup, you just need to add an `id` named `"card-container-front"` to the div with the front class as seen below

![html2canvas id side.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667702699212/yTr74kU8R.png align="left")

So that's the section we want to convert to PNG

Now, in your JavaScript file.

### Step 2 - Selecting global variables and setting event listeners

Let's select the button and save to a new variable -

```javascript
const downloadCard= document.querySelector('.download-card')
```

Then, we just need to add an event listener to the button, so that when we click on it, the card gets downloaded.

```javascript
downloadCard.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // code goes here
});
```

### Step 3 - Implementing the html2canvas library

Moving on, this is the time to call on the html2canvas library

The syntax goes thus ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
html2canvas (areaToBeScreenshotted).then(canvas)=>{
// convert to PNG file here
}
```

Remember, `html2canvas` accepts a parameter which is the section you want to take a snapshot of.

So, we'll just select the element from the html file using the DOM querySelector.

```javascript
html2canvas (document.querySelector("#card-container-front"))
```

After this, we pass a canvas parameter for the `.then()` function.

This `canvas` serves as a placeholder for the element selected on the `html2canvas` parameter

***Note that the parameter for the html2canvas can be any part of your html markup.***

So the html2canvas library function should look like this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
downloadCard.addEventListener("click", () => {
html2canvas (document.querySelector("#card-container-front")).then((canvas) => {
  // Rest of code goes here
});
```

Still within the html2canvas library function...

The next thing to do is select the download link to make the canvas downloadable.

Remember, you have an anchor tag in the html file saved under -

```javascript
<a href="#" id="download-link" download="MyBusinessCard.png"></a>
```

So let's select that and save it under downloadLink variable

```javascript
let downloadLink = document.getElementById("download-link");
```

Now, we can convert the canvas to the `toDataURL()` method.

```javascript
downloadLink.href = canvas.toDataURL();
```

According to MDN, the toDataURL() method returns a data URL containing a representation of the image in the format specified by the type parameter.

If nothing is specified, it returns the `image/png` format. [Read more about toDataURL method here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL)

Now, we can assign this URL to the `downloadLink href`. Then use the `click()` method to simulate the click event on the converted canvas

```javascript
downloadLink.click()
```

Your JavaScript file should end up like this

```javascript
const downloadCard = document.querySelector(".download-card");

downloadCard.addEventListener("click", () => {
  html2canvas (document.querySelector("#card-container-front")).then((canvas) => {
    let downloadLink = document.getElementById("download-link"); 
    downloadLink.href = canvas.toDataURL(); 
    downloadLink.click();
  });
});
```

Now, when you click on the `downloadCard` button, you can successfully download any specified section of your page.

As seen below.

And that's it.
