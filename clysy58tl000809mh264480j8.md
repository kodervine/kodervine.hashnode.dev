If you’ve been trying to redirect users within a Shopify Remix app and hitting roadblocks with `navigate`, `redirect`, or even `window.location.href`, then this article is for you. This is one of the issues when especially when integrating Shopify apps with Remix. The good news is that `window.parent.location.href` can solve this problem.

In this article, I'll show you why those methods fail and how you can use `window.parent.location.href` to successfully redirect users to a custom url.

## The Problem

When working within Shopify's embedded app environment, you might encounter issues with standard redirect methods. Here's a quick rundown of the issues you might face:

1. `navigate`: This method might append the new URL to the existing one, leading to malformed URLs.
    
2. `redirect`: This can prevent the Shopify app from loading correctly.
    
3. `window.location.href`: Sometimes, it simply doesn't lead to any page, leaving you stuck.
    

## The Solution: `window.parent.location.href`

To overcome these issues, `window.parent.location.href` ensures that the whole window (not just the `iframe`) navigates to the new URL.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Ensure Proper Imports**: Make sure you have the necessary imports for your icons and other utilities.
    
2. **Implement** `window.parent.location.href` in Your `ActionListDropdown`: Update your redirection logic to use this method.
    

Here’s how you can do it:

### Example Code

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { EditIcon } from '@shopify/polaris-icons';
import { ActionList, Popover } from '@shopify/polaris';
import { useLoaderData, useParams } from "@remix-run/react";

const ListDropdown = ({ actionList }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Popover
      >
        <ActionList
          actionRole="menuitem"
          items={actionList}
        />
      </Popover>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
const params = useParams()
  const {
    meta: { shop },
  }= useLoaderData();
  const handleRedirect = () => {
    const productUrl = `https://admin.shopify.com/store/${shop}/products/${getSplitIdValue(id)}`;
    window.parent.location.href = productUrl;
  };

  return (
    <ListDropdown
      actionList={[
        {
          content: "Edit",
          icon: EditIcon,
          onAction: handleRedirect,
        },
      ]}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation

* `window.parent.location.href`: This ensures the redirection happens at the top-level window, bypassing the `iframe` restrictions.
    
* **Event Handlers**: The `onClick` event handlers in the `ListDropdown` trigger the redirection for the "Advanced" button and the modal opening for the "Delete" button.
    

### Additional Tip

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have installed the required Shopify libraries as well as set up authentication, and user sessions.
    
2. **Check Authentication**: Make sure you’re logged into the Shopify admin to avoid redirection to the login page.
