I was working on a react native project with expo and I ran into this bug.  
My app bundles successfully but it just doesn't initialize the app, but leaves it stuck on the Splash screen. Also, no errors on the terminal.

But when I reload the expo project, it shows that the metro is disconnected

## Solution

What resolved this for me were:

1\. Try checking the expo version. Either uninstall and reinstall the version of the expo apk on your device  
2\. If you scan the expo qrcode like in the image below, try manually typing in the ip address displayed after the text: "Metro waiting on ..."
