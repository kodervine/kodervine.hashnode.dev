## Introduction:

Managing state is crucial when developing React applications to create robust and efficient web applications. React offers two primary options for state management: global state and component state. In this article, we will explore the considerations and best practices for choosing between global state and component state, with a specific focus on accessing input values.

## Understanding Global State and Component State:

Global state refers to a shared state accessible by multiple components throughout an application. It provides a centralized data store, enabling components to read and modify the state as needed. Some of the popular global state management libraries in React include Redux and Context API.

Component state, on the other hand, is specific to a particular component. It encapsulates the state within the component's scope, making it accessible within that component. React's useState hook is commonly used for managing component state.

## Choosing Global State:

Global state is a suitable choice when multiple components need access to the same input values. Consider these scenarios:  

### 1\. Shared Input Values:

If multiple components across different parts of your application require access to the same input values, using global state provides a convenient and efficient solution. Real-time updates ensure that all components display consistent values. For example, in an e-commerce application, both a shopping cart component and a product details component might need access to the current selected quantity.

### 2\. Complex Interactions:

When interactions between components and input values involve complex data flows or dependency on each other's states, the global state simplifies communication and synchronization. For instance, in a multi-step form where each step depends on data from previous steps, the global state facilitates passing input values and maintaining the overall form state without prop drilling or event handling.

### 3\. Cross-Component Communication:

The global state enables easy data sharing or action triggering between components that are not directly related in the component's hierarchy. This eliminates the need for prop drilling. For example, in a messaging app, a message list component and a compose message component can communicate through global state, allowing the compose message component to add new messages while the message list component dynamically updates.

## Utilizing Component State:

Component state is preferable when input values are only needed within a specific component or limited scope. Let's consider the following scenarios:  

### 1\. Localized Input Values:

If input values are used and managed exclusively within a single component, utilizing component state is generally more efficient and straightforward. This approach reduces complexity and keeps state management localized. For example, in a form with a single input field for the user's name, component state is sufficient as the input value is only needed within the form component itself.

### 2\. Isolated Reusability:

Component state is beneficial when creating reusable components that encapsulate functionality such as forms. It allows each instance of the component to manage its own state independently, ensuring better encapsulation and independence. For example, a custom input component that encapsulates Formik (a react library that handles form validation and submission) and handles specific validation logic can utilize component state, enabling each instance to manage its state without conflicts.

### 3\. Performance Optimization:

Using global state for input values can introduce unnecessary overhead, leading to excessive re-rendering of unrelated components. Keeping the state localized within the component helps optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders. In large applications with numerous components, using global state for every input value can end up being inefficient. Utilizing component state reduces re-rendering to the relevant components:

## Usecases for Global and Component states.

1. ### Using useContext (Global State):
    

```javascript
// InputContext.js

import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

const InputContext = createContext();
const InputProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  const updateInputValue = (value) => {
    setInputValue(value);
  };


  return (
    <InputContext.Provider value={{ inputValue, updateInputValue }}>
      {children}
    </InputContext.Provider>

  );

};


export { InputContext, InputProvider };

```

\*\*\*

```javascript
// InputComponent.js

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { InputContext } from './InputContext';

const InputComponent = () => {
  const { inputValue, updateInputValue } = useContext(InputContext);
  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    updateInputValue(e.target.value);
  };


  return (
    <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
  );

};


export default InputComponent;
```

1. ## Using Redux (Global State):
    

```javascript
// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';


const initialState = {
  inputValue: '',
};


function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_INPUT':
      return {
        ...state,
        inputValue: action.payload,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}


const store = createStore(reducer);
export default store;

```

\*\*

```javascript
// InputComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const InputComponent = () => {
  const inputValue = useSelector((state) => state.inputValue);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_INPUT', payload: e.target.value });
  };

  return (
    <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
  );
};

export default InputComponent;
```

1. ### Using useState hook (Component State):
    

```javascript
// InputComponent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const InputComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
  );
};


export default InputComponent;
```

### **Code Explanation**

In the first example, the `useContext` hook is used to create a context called `InputContext`, which holds the input value and a function to update it. The InputProvider component provides the context values to its children. The `InputComponent` accesses the `input` value and update function from the context using useContext.

The second example demonstrates using `Redux`. The defined `inputReducer` handles state updates for the `input` value. The `InputComponent` then uses `useDispatch` to dispatch actions and `useSelector` to access the input value from the global Redux store.

The third example shows using `useState` hook to manage the input value state within the `InputComponent`. The `setInputValue` function is used to update the input value based on the user's input in same component.

## **When to consider using global or component states**

Choosing between global state and component state in React involves weighing the trade-offs associated with each approach. Both global state and component state have their advantages and considerations, and understanding these trade-offs is crucial for making an informed decision for your web application.

### Global State

Global state provides a centralized data store that can be accessed by multiple components throughout an application. This centralized nature simplifies data sharing and communication between components.

With global state, you can easily share input values and state updates across different parts of your application. It eliminates the need for prop drilling or event bubbling, making the code more concise and readable.

However, global state can introduce additional complexity to your application. As the state becomes shared and accessible to multiple components, managing the dependencies and synchronization between components becomes more challenging.

Changes to the global state can potentially trigger cascading updates and re-renders across a large number of components, leading to performance issues. Additionally, incorporating a global state management library, such as Redux or Context API, adds extra overhead and boilerplate code.

### Component state

On the other hand, component state offers localized and independent state management within a specific component or scope. It provides a straightforward and efficient solution for managing input values that are only needed within a particular component. Component state keeps the state management confined to the component itself, reducing complexity and potential conflicts with other components.

Component state is particularly useful for creating reusable components that encapsulate functionality, such as forms. Each instance of the component can manage its own state independently, ensuring better encapsulation and independence. This enhances code modularity and maintainability.

  
However, using component state exclusively can lead to isolated islands of state, making it challenging to share data or communicate between components that are not directly related in the component hierarchy. Prop drilling, passing down props through intermediate components, or event bubbling may be necessary to share state between components, introducing additional code and complexity.

When considering trade-offs, it's essential to assess your application's specific requirements. If multiple components across different parts of your application need access to the same input values or if complex interactions and data flows are involved, global state can simplify communication and offer synchronization.

On the other hand, if input values are only needed within a specific component or limited scope, utilizing component state can provide a more efficient and straightforward solution. It keeps the state localized and reduces unnecessary re-renders. However, the potential challenges of sharing data between components and the impact on code complexity is another factor to consider in the long term.

## **Wrapping Up**

Decisively, the choice between global state and component state depends on the specific context and requirements of your React application. It's important to carefully assess the trade-offs and consider the impact on performance, complexity, and code maintainability. This will enable you to strike the right balance between global state and component state to create a robust React application and ensure an intuitive user experience for visitors to your websites.
